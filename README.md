## Hi there 👋

### I am making a change from running a group of restaurants to learning and growing as a software engineer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity to get some hands on experience in the web3 world
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project to create a finance dashboard to keep an eye on market moves and the treasury yield curve
