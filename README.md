## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am making a change from running a group of restaurants to learning and growing as a software engineer.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking an AWS Essentials Course and practicing my skills in Docker
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my personal finance project I built to keep an eye on market moves alongside the treasury yield curve
     * This project uses a Python Flask backend with a Typescript React frontend
