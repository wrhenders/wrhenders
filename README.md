## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am making a change from running a group of restaurants to learning and growing as a software engineer.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity to get some hands on experience in the web3 world
* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project to create a finance dashboard to keep an eye on market moves and the treasury yield curve
     * This project uses a Python Flask backend with a Typescript React frontend
